# Requirements Document - Complete CityVille Game

## Introduction

CityVille 2025 is an AI-first city building simulation game that needs to be completed from its current foundational state to a fully functional, playable game. The project has established architecture, documentation, and basic project structure, but requires implementation of core game systems, user interface, backend services, and deployment infrastructure to deliver a complete gaming experience.

The game should provide engaging city building mechanics with real-time multiplayer capabilities, economic systems, quest progression, and social features, all delivered through a modern web-based platform with high performance and scalability.

2. WHEN a player completes objectives THEN the system SHALL update quest progress and notify them of completion
3. WHEN quests are completed THEN the system SHALL award appropriate rewards (coins, experience, items) and update player stats
4. WHEN a player gains enough experience THEN the system SHALL level them up and unlock new buildings or features
5. WHEN daily/weekly quests reset THEN the system SHALL generate new appropriate challenges based on player level
6. IF quest requirements are met THEN the system SHALL automatically detect completion and allow reward claiming

### Requirement 5: User Interface and Experience

**User Story:** As a player, I want an intuitive and responsive interface so that I can easily navigate the game and access all features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game loads THEN the system SHALL display a clean, responsive UI that works on desktop and tablet devices
2. WHEN a player needs information THEN the system SHALL provide tooltips, help text, and clear visual indicators
3. WHEN a player navigates between screens THEN the system SHALL maintain smooth transitions and preserve game state
4. WHEN notifications occur THEN the system SHALL display them in a non-intrusive manner with appropriate priority
5. WHEN a player customizes settings THEN the system SHALL persist preferences and apply them consistently
6. IF the interface becomes unresponsive THEN the system SHALL provide loading indicators and error recovery options

### Requirement 6: Backend Services Architecture

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want scalable backend services so that the game can handle thousands of concurrent players reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN all microservices SHALL be healthy and ready to handle requests within 30 seconds
2. WHEN API requests are made THEN the system SHALL respond within 150ms for 95% of requests
3. WHEN database operations occur THEN the system SHALL maintain ACID properties and handle concurrent access safely
4. WHEN services communicate THEN the system SHALL use event-driven architecture with NATS for reliable message delivery
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log them appropriately and implement circuit breaker patterns for resilience
6. IF load increases THEN the system SHALL auto-scale horizontally based on defined metrics

### Requirement 7: Data Persistence and Security

**User Story:** As a player, I want my game progress to be saved securely so that I never lose my city or achievements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player makes progress THEN the system SHALL automatically save their state to PostgreSQL with backup redundancy
2. WHEN a player logs in THEN the system SHALL authenticate them securely using JWT tokens with appropriate expiration
